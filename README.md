# unit-4-game
In this assignment, I created another fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, my app dynamically updates my HTML pages with the jQuery library.

## Instruction and Skills Acquired:

1. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/klN2-ITjRt8).

2. Here's how the app works:

   * When the game starts, the player will choose a character by clicking on the fighter's picture. The player will fight as that character for the rest of the game.

   * The player must then defeat all of the remaining fighters. Enemies should be moved to a different area of the screen.

   * The player chooses an opponent by clicking on an enemy's picture.

   * Once the player selects an opponent, that enemy is moved to a `defender area`.

   * The player will now be able to click the `attack` button.
     * Whenever the player clicks `attack`, their character damages the defender. The opponent will lose `HP` (health points). These points are displayed at the bottom of the defender's picture. 
     * The opponent character will instantly counter the attack. When that happens, the player's character will lose some of their `HP`. These points are shown at the bottom of the player character's picture.

3. The player will keep hitting the attack button in an effort to defeat their opponent.

   * When the defender's `HP` is reduced to zero or below, remove the enemy from the `defender area`. The player character can now choose a new opponent.

4. The player wins the game by defeating all enemy characters. The player loses the game the game if their character's `HP` falls to zero or below.
